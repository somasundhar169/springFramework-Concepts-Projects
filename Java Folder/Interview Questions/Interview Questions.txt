23.String vs StringBuffer?
24.Package vs sub-Package?  Package inside package
25.Can we Override static methods?No,Static Methods is binded with class During compile Time.But Overriding is achieved in RunTime.
26.Can We override Main Method?NO,Main Method is Static Method.
27. String s=new String();

12.fork Join() in MultiThread?

OOPS:
1.What is OOPS?Loose coupling & Dynamic Binding achieved.
2.Abstract vs Encapsulation.
3.Overloading vs overloading
4.Can we Inherit Constructors? No,We cant Inherit contructors.We only Inherit variables & methods.
5.Inheritance?Types?Explain?
6.Abstraction?
7.Polymorphism?Method overloading vs Method Overiding?  
8.How to create Immutable Class? 



 Exception Handling:
1.why do we use Exception Handlings?
2.Can we use multiple Catch blocks?
3.Types of Exceptions? checked(IO Exception,SQL EXCEP,File not found,classNot found) & unchecked Exceptions(Arithmetic,ArrayIndexoutofBound,Nullpointer)
4.Finally(is a block along with try always execute irrespective of exception rise or not.to close database connections to avoid leakage) vs final (final var,final class,final method)
5.throw(Unchecked Excep,throw only single Exception explicitly or manually & write - inside Method) vs throws(Checked Excep,declare an Exception which might be thrown by method & throw multiple Exceptions & write - along with Method)
6.Do we create our own Exceptions?
7.When Null pointer Exception will come?
8.when do we get Checked Exceptions?
9.what is the use of Exception reference?
